# Loan Acceptance Predictor
# Project Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model to determine whether a loan application will be accepted or rejected. By leveraging historical loan application data and machine learning techniques, the model provides insights into key factors influencing loan approval decisions and helps streamline the loan approval process.

# Data

The dataset used in this project contains historical loan application data with features such as applicant's income, loan amount, credit history, etc. The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

# Usage

1. Data Preprocessing:
   Use the data_preprocessing.ipynb notebook to clean and preprocess the raw data.
2. Model Training:
    Train the model using the model_training.ipynb notebook.
3. Model Evaluation:
    Evaluate the model's performance using the evaluation.ipynb notebook.
4. Prediction:
    Use the trained model to predict loan acceptance for new data.

# Model Training

The model is trained using logistic regression. The training process includes splitting the data into training and testing sets, fitting the model on the training data, and tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.

# Evaluation
The model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into the model's performance in predicting loan acceptance.

# Prediction
To make predictions on new loan applications, prepare the input data in the required format and use the trained model. The prediction script or the web interface can be used for this purpose.
